Need to make a call to send a custom 2 x 1 label format to a rollo printer (x1040).
Here is the printer: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VF4Z2WQ/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00
Here is the label: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NDMLGDB?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_ypp_rep_k1_1_7
Here is the node.js/typescript code to call API:  https://github.com/artiebits/pdf-to-printer#printpdf-options--promisevoid
I see there is a "rollo-printer"  in the package.json so I'm assuming it would work.
Please check in your code to your own branch.
